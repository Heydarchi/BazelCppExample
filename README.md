# BazelCppExample
A simple Bazel Example to build a cpp project

This example shows how much it's easy and simple to setup a C++ project with Bazel while you have a clean, flexible and mangable structure of the build system.

# Make sure that you've installed Bazel 
# How to build
>bazel build //app:test_app

Then the path of the runnable app will be printed.
